              CIDR notation is a compact way to represent subnet masks. Instead of writing out the full subnet mask (like 255.255.255.0), 
              we just write the number of network bits after a forward slash (like /24). This makes it easier to work with and understand subnet sizes.

              Think of the subnet mask as a filter. When you perform a bitwise AND between an IP and its subnet mask, 
              you're essentially "filtering out" the host bits, leaving only the network portion. If this matches the network address, 
              the IP belongs to that subnet!

              Remember this mnemonic: "Broadcast is all ones in the host bits." When converting to binary, 
              the network bits stay the same as the network address, but all host bits become 1s. 
              Alternatively, you can find it by subtracting 1 from the next network address.

              The network address is like the "floor" of a subnet - it's the lowest possible address in that subnet. 
              When you perform a bitwise AND between an IP and its subnet mask, you're essentially "zeroing out" 
              all the host bits, which gives you the network address.

              Think of the host range as the "usable space" between the network address and broadcast address. 
              The first usable host is always network address + 1, and the last usable host is broadcast address - 1. 
              Remember: network and broadcast addresses are like the "walls" of the subnet - you can't use them for hosts!

              The formula 2^(32-CIDR) - 2 might look intimidating, but here's a simple way to think about it: 
              CIDR is the number of network bits in the subnet mask. Since there's 32 bits in an IP address, 
              the number of host bits (32-CIDR) tells you how many unique addresses you can make without changing the network portion. 
              We subtract 2 because the network and broadcast addresses are reserved. For example, in a /24 network, 
              you have 8 host bits (32-24), so 2^8 = 256 total addresses, minus 2 reserved addresses = 254 usable hosts.

              A subnet mask is like a "template" that shows which bits are for the network and which are for hosts. 
              The 1s in the mask represent network bits, and the 0s represent host bits. 
              Common subnet masks like 255.255.255.0 (/24) are easy to remember, but for others, 
              you can break them down into octets and convert each to binary.
